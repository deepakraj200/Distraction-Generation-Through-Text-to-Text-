      "question": "What is the primary goal of DevOps?",
      "selected": "To improve the quality of software",
      "correct": "To increase the speed of software delivery",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on your answer! While improving the quality of software is certainly an important aspect of DevOps, it's not the primary goal. The primary goal of DevOps is actually to increase the speed of software delivery, which involves streamlining the development, testing, and deployment process to get software into users' hands faster and more reliably. By focusing on speed, DevOps aims to improve collaboration, reduce errors, and increase customer satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between Agile and DevOps?",
      "selected": "Agile focuses on iterative development, while DevOps focuses on continuous delivery",
      "correct": "Agile focuses on customer feedback, while DevOps focuses on team collaboration",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on this question! While you're on the right track, your answer isn't entirely accurate. Agile does involve iterative development, but its core focus is actually on incorporating customer feedback to deliver a product that meets their needs. Meanwhile, DevOps is more about fostering collaboration between development and operations teams to ensure smooth deployment and delivery of software. Keep working on understanding the nuances of these methodologies, and you'll be a pro in no time!"

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of Continuous Integration in DevOps?",
      "selected": "To track changes to code",
      "correct": "To track changes to code",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "feedback": "Correct! Well done."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the benefit of using Infrastructure as Code in DevOps?",
      "selected": "It increases the speed of infrastructure provisioning",
      "correct": "It simplifies the management of infrastructure",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on this question! While it's true that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can increase the speed of infrastructure provisioning, that's not the primary benefit. The correct answer is that IaC simplifies the management of infrastructure because it allows for version control, consistency, and reproducibility of infrastructure configurations. This makes it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure over time, which is a key aspect of DevOps. Keep up the good work, and remember to think about the broader implications"

    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Scrum Master in a DevOps team?",
      "selected": "To lead the development team",
      "correct": "To facilitate team collaboration",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on this question! However, the Scrum Master's role is not to lead the development team, but rather to facilitate team collaboration and ensure the Scrum framework is followed. This means they focus on removing obstacles, fostering communication, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement, rather than directing the team's work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of Continuous Monitoring in DevOps?",
      "selected": "To improve code quality",
      "correct": "To identify performance issues",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on attempting this question! While improving code quality is an important aspect of DevOps, it's not the primary purpose of Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring is actually focused on identifying performance issues and detecting anomalies in real-time, allowing teams to quickly respond to problems and ensure the system's reliability. By understanding this purpose, you'll be able to leverage Continuous Monitoring to optimize your system's performance and user experience!"

      "question": "What is the advantage of using DevOps in software development?",
      "selected": "It improves the quality of software",
      "correct": "It increases the speed of software delivery",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on your answer! While it's true that DevOps can have a positive impact on software quality, the primary advantage of using DevOps is actually that it enables faster and more reliable software delivery. By automating and streamlining the development and deployment process, DevOps allows teams to release software updates more quickly and frequently, which is a key benefit in today's fast-paced tech landscape. Keep thinking about the bigger picture, and you're on the right track!"
