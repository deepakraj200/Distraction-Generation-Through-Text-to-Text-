      "question": "What is the primary goal of DevOps?",
      "selected": "To improve the quality of software",
      "correct": "To increase the speed of software delivery",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on this question! While improving the quality of software is definitely an important aspect of DevOps, it's not the primary goal. The primary goal of DevOps is actually to increase the speed of software delivery, which allows for faster time-to-market and more rapid response to changing customer needs. By focusing on speed and efficiency, DevOps enables teams to deliver high-quality software more quickly and reliably."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between Agile and DevOps?",
      "selected": "Agile focuses on iterative development, while DevOps focuses on continuous delivery",
      "correct": "Agile focuses on customer feedback, while DevOps focuses on team collaboration",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on this question! While you're on the right track, your answer isn't entirely accurate. Agile does involve iterative development, but its core focus is actually on incorporating customer feedback to drive development. Meanwhile, DevOps is more about fostering collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to ensure smooth delivery and deployment of software. Keep working on understanding the nuances of these methodologies!"

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of Continuous Integration in DevOps?",
      "selected": "To track changes to code",
      "correct": "To track changes to code",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "feedback": "Correct! Well done."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the benefit of using Infrastructure as Code in DevOps?",
      "selected": "It increases the speed of infrastructure provisioning",
      "correct": "It simplifies the management of infrastructure",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on your answer! While it's true that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can increase the speed of infrastructure provisioning, that's not the primary benefit. The correct answer is that IaC simplifies the management of infrastructure because it allows for version control, consistency, and reproducibility of infrastructure configurations. This makes it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure over time, which is a key aspect of DevOps. Keep going, you're on the right track!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Scrum Master in a DevOps team?",
      "selected": "To lead the development team",
      "correct": "To facilitate team collaboration",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on attempting this question! However, the Scrum Master's role goes beyond leading the development team. In a DevOps team, the Scrum Master's primary responsibility is to facilitate team collaboration, remove impediments, and ensure the Scrum framework is followed, rather than leading the team. This allows the team to work together more effectively and efficiently, which is a key aspect of DevOps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of Continuous Monitoring in DevOps?",
      "selected": "To improve code quality",
      "correct": "To identify performance issues",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on your answer! While improving code quality is an important aspect of DevOps, it's not the primary purpose of Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring is actually focused on identifying performance issues and detecting anomalies in real-time, so that teams can quickly respond to problems and ensure the system is running smoothly. By doing so, teams can ensure a better user experience and reduce downtime. Keep up the good work, and remember to think about the bigger picture of DevOps practices!"

      "question": "What is the advantage of using DevOps in software development?",
      "selected": "It improves the quality of software",
      "correct": "It increases the speed of software delivery",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "Great effort on your answer! While it's true that DevOps can lead to higher quality software, the primary advantage of using DevOps in software development is actually that it increases the speed of software delivery. This is because DevOps focuses on automating and streamlining the development and deployment process, allowing teams to release software updates more quickly and efficiently. Keep up the good work, and let's explore more about DevOps in our next lesson!"
